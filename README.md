RESI-DATA is a real estate analysis service that provides easy-to-grasp analyses of housing data on the county level to help you make the most informed decision on your biggest investment. Whether you are looking to buy a home or invest inproperty, Resi-Data can help you narrow down your search based on previous market trends and high level forecasting.

## Project Proposal

> The goal of this project is to develop a streamlit application to aid users in navigating the Dallas-Fort-Worth housing market. The application includes interactive visualizations based on county-level housing data, and forecasts future real estate market performance for DFW based on data from previous years.

## Finding Data

> We used data from [redfin](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/) and the [Texas Real Estate Research Center](https://www.recenter.tamu.edu/data/housing-activity/#!/activity/State/Texas) to analyze housing trends on the county level.


## Model Evaluation
 > We used two different methods of forecasting.
    > ARIMA
    > Neural Network
    
 > An AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to predict future trends. ARIMA models are used in time series forecasting by describing the autocorrelations in the data.
 
 > We used NeuralProphet to create a Neural Network based Time Series Forecasting Model. NeuralProphet is a hybrid forecasting framework based on PyTorch that employs standard deep learning methods, making it easy for developers to extend the framework.
