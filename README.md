# Project 3


## Project Proposal

> For our project...

## Finding Data

## Model Evaluation
 > We used two different methods of forecasting.
    > ARIMA
    > Neural Network
    
 > An AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to predict future trends. ARIMA models are used in time series forecasting by describing the autocorrelations in the data.
 
 > We used NeuralProphet to create a Neural Network based Time Series Forecasting Model. NeuralProphet is a hybrid forecasting framework based on PyTorch that employs standard deep learning methods, making it easy for developers to extend the framework.
